# 2. Write a Python function that takes two lists of integers as input and returns a new list containing only the numbers that are present in both lists, but with each number appearing only once in the final list.

# # Q2
# num1 = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
# num2 = [2,4,8]
# final =[4,10]

# for i in num1:
#     for j in num2:
#         if i == j:
#             if i not in final:
#                 final.append(i)
# print(final) # [4,10,2,8]
