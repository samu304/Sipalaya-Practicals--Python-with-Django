# 4. Write a Python function that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list with the elements sorted in descending order, but with all odd numbers appearing before all even numbers.



# def sort(numbers):
#     odd = []
#     even = []

#     for num in numbers:
#         if num % 2 == 0:
#             even.append(num)
#         else:
#             odd.append(num)

#     odd.sort(reverse=True)
#     even.sort(reverse=True)

#     result = odd + even
#     print(result)

# sort([4,7,2,9,10,1,20,3,8,5])
