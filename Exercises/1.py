# Q1
""" 
 An extra day is added to the calendar almost every four years as February 29, and the day is called a leap day. It corrects the calendar for the fact that our planet takes approximately 365.25 days to orbit the sun. A leap year contains a leap day.
In the Gregorian calendar, three conditions are used to identify leap years:
● The year can be evenly divided by 4, is a leap year, unless:
■ The year can be evenly divided by 100, it is NOT a leap year, unless:
● The year is also evenly divisible by 400. Then it is a leap year. This means that in the Gregorian calendar, the years 2000 and 2400 are leap years,
while 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200, 2300 and 2500 are NOT leap years.
Given a year, determine whether it is a leap year. If it is a leap year, return the Boolean True, otherwise return False. """
