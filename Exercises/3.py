# 3. Write a Python program that takes a string as input and returns a dictionary where each key is a unique word in the string and the value is a list of the indices where that word appears in the string.

# # Q3
# string = input("Enter a sentence: ")
# def sentence(string):
#     words = string.split()
#     w_dict ={}

#     for count,num in enumerate(words):
#         if num in w_dict:
#             w_dict[num].append(count)
#         else:
#             w_dict[num] = count

#     print(w_dict)

# sentence(string)
